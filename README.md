FFXIV Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) LogParse Overlay for Fishing

# Requirements
Requires ACT with the hibiyasleep's Overlay Plugin >=0.3.3.14 for LogParse support.

# Install
1. In ACT, under the `Plugins` tab choose the `OverlayPlugin.dll` and then click `New`.
2. Name it whatever you'd like and select `Log Parse` as the `Type`, then click `OK`.
3. Download the `fishing.html` from this repo and choose it as your URL.

# Notes
This is just something I whipped up in an afternoon, probably missing cases for when to stop the timer, and definitely lacking non-dev friendly customization. Additionally there's lots of features I could imagine building on top of this, but for now it's just a timer.
